	    <h4>Feeling shaky after a workout? Here is what you need to know!</h4>
 <img src="./feeling-shaky.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>What happens when you try planking for the first time? You take your position, you engage your muscles, and on a count of 10 or hardly 15, your body starts to feel the earthquake inside, try holding yourself in the same position, engaging the same muscle and you'll find yourself down on the floor. You feel the same when you engage in intense workouts, and it's completely normal.</p>
<p>So, what's this shaky feeling all about? What causes this earthquake-like feeling in your body? Is there anything that you can do about it?</p>
<p>The answers to all these questions are here!</p>
<h4>Why do you feel shaking post-workout?</h4>
<p>Reasons can be many, though you need to take note of any other symptoms if you have. Shake-age, a highly technical term defines that when you engage your muscles extremely hard, they start to shake.</p>
<p>Let's explore the possible causes and what can make you feel  <a href="https://habitfit.in/blogs/03-04-2021/how-to-reduce-stress.html"> <strong> shaky after a workout</strong></a>.</p>
<h4>Muscle fatigue</h4>
<img src="./muscle-fatigue.jpg" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>One of the most common reasons for tremors, muscle fatigue is the condition when your CNS (central nervous system) loses its ability to make forceful movements in your muscles, and this can make you experience shaking or twitching.</p>
<p>When you feel muscle fatigue, this signifies that you have reached the maximum limit, this is more common when you engage in tougher workouts.</p>
<p>It is advisable to reduce the intensity of your workout when you have already pushed yourself too hard and you are in pain.</p>
<h4>Holding a muscle for long in the same position</h4>
<img src="./holding-a-muscle.jpg" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>Coming back to the plank talk, this is due to the activities of motor units some of which are only used during the powerful movements.</p>
<p>For instance, when you plank, you will notice that your arms and your core muscles are more likely to shake. IN general, you will experience the shaking in the muscles that are being worked out.</p>
<h4>Low blood sugar</h4>
<p>Also regarded as hypoglycemia, low blood sugar can be another reason why your muscles shake after a workout. Especially, when you workout for a longer duration or you engage in an intense workout, your glucose levels are more likely to decrease.</p>
<p>Your muscles need and use glucose to fuel and when without sufficient fuel, your muscles start to shake.</p>
<p>When glucose levels decrease, you can also experience fatigue, irritability, confusion, dizziness, headache, weakness, and/or hunger.</p>
<h4>When you are dehydrated</h4>
<img src="./dehydrated.jpg" class="w-100 mb-2" />
 <p>When you workout, it is important to keep your electrolyte levels balanced, and to do so, you need to stay hydrated. During a workout (especially intense once), you may sweat a lot and lose water, the same applies when you do some exercises outdoor on a hot day.</p>
<p>When you sweat too much and become dehydrated, you are more likely to face muscle twitching and cramps along with skating of muscles.</p>
<h4>When your caffeine intake is high</h4>
<p>This can come as surprise to many as a lot of people drink coffee and other caffeine-containing beverages before a workout to power the muscles, but if you consume too much, this can lead to shaking of muscles. Your hands and limbs are more likely to get affected when you consume too much caffeine before a workout.</p>
<h4>What can you do about it?</h4>
<p>If you start to feel shaking of muscles, there are a few things that can help you find a way out.</p>

<ul>
            <li>Overworked muscles tend to shake, provide them with some rest.</li>
            <li>Eat healthy post-workout meals to fuel your muscles.</li>
            <li>Restore your fluid levels by drinking sufficient water.</li>
            <li>Some stretching after a workout can help you loosen your muscles and prevent aches and cramps.</li>
</ul>       

<h5>The last rep!</h5>
<p>Shaking after a workout is common and is not a matter of concern. So, now you must be well aware of what's that post-workout shaking is all about, don't forget to share with your fitness freak friend and loved ones!</p>
