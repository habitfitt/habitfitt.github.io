<img src="./Burpee.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>Get ready for a head-to-toe workout. In a simple way, you need to go from a push-up position to a jump and then you need to get back to the push-up position.</p>
<p>This is a full-body calisthenics workout that also adds strength and endurance to your lower and upper body.</p>
<h4>Medicine ball slam</h4>
<p>Stand straight, keep your hands in front of you while holding the medicine ball, take the ball over your head until your hands get straight. Now, it is time to take out all your frustration by slamming the ball on the ground, squat down towards the ground by following the ball. From your core and shoulders to your lats and haps, the medicine ball slam is a full-body workout that also strengthens your cardiovascular system.</p>
<h4>Dumbbell overhead lunge</h4>
<p>During a lunge, add a dumbbell overhead, and when you shift load with every rep, the weight should be kept above you and all the muscles in your torso need to work together.</p>
<p>It is a stability exercise and this workout lengthens and contracts your core muscles. Your feet should be kept shoulder-width apart, your knees should be bent slightly. Do not forget to inhale when you raise the dumbbell above your head. </p>
<p>Exhale while moving into the deep lunge position. Switch sides and repeat, perform 10 reps with both legs. </p>
<h4>Mountain climbers</h4>
