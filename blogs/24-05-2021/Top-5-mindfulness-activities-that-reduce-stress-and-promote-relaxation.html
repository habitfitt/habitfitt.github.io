	    <h4>Top 5 mindfulness activities that reduce stress and promote relaxation</h4>
<p>Feeling stressed out, nervous, anxious, and angry- all are common negative feelings that we want to disappear quickly. These unwanted feelings are natural and can strike without any prior notice. Of course, you can't sit comfortably with these uncomfortable emotions, especially when these emotions stay with you for long.</p>
<p>The key to dealing with these emotions is by accepting and acting wisely. The reason being, denying these emotions can make conditions intense and even worse.</p>
<p>And, once you master the art of accepting, another important way is to practice mindfulness!</p>
<h4>Some mindfulness activities that promote relaxation </h4>
<p>Check out these amazing activities and they will surely help you in many ways</p>
<h3>Deep breathing</h3>
<img src="./deep-breathing .png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>The quality of your breathing tells a lot about how you feel inside, and where your headspace is at. For instance, when you feel anxious, your breathing can be constrained, short, or shallow. This is where practicing deep breathing can work wonders as it helps to bring you to the present moment while relaxing your nervous system.</p>
<p>You can connect with an <a href= "https://habitfit.in/"><strong> online personal trainer </strong> </a> if you are new to deep breathing exercises. Certified yogis can guide you in the right direction and make your exercises more and more effective.</p>
<h4>Candle study </h4>
<p>Okay, so now it's time for some "ME" time! Candle study is a kind of meditation and this small practice surely revitalizes your mind and body</p>
<p>Sit comfortably and light your favorite candle, gaze at the candle for around 5 to 10 minutes, and allow your mind to think freely. Observe your thoughts, don't judge, and let all the thoughts pass. Once you practice this exercise, you will feel calm and relaxed, and that the obvious goal.</p>
<h4>Gratitude list</h4>
<img src="./Gratitude-list .png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>Here comes one of the quickest mindfulness activities that provide you with instant results. This practice becomes more important when you find yourself in difficult times as it will help you realize what's working. You can do this early morning or when you go to bed, simply prepare a list of 10 things that you are grateful for. </p>
<p>This will change your focus from negative to positive and it will make you feel amazing in no time!</p>
<h4>The chime game </h4>
<p>An activity that you can do in a group with your near and dear ones, you need a chime or bell for this. This sound game keeps you away from negative emotions and also helps you focus on the present. This practice helps you observe your current mental state and emotions that are needed to be avoided. </p>
<h4>Stillness exercise</h4>
<p>This one is also like meditation in which you need to focus on your breath, any kind of mantra that you like, or it can be an image in your mind that you want to focus on. You can do this practice for 5 to 10 minutes or as long as you want. </p>
<p>This is a single-point concentration technique that helps your mind to settle. It may not be possible to keep your focus on one thing (initially) and that should not be a matter of concern.</p>
<h5>Summing it up </h5>
<p>These mindfulness activities will surely help you find peace and relaxation, try them, and also share them with your loved ones!</p>
