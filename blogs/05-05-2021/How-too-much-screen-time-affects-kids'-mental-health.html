	    <h4>How too much screen time affects kids' mental health?</h4> https://habitfit.in/
  <img src="./kids'-mental-health.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>In today's digital age where everything clicks, blinks, and connects, kids have easy access to screens. And, they are spending more time than ever in front of the screen. Especially, due to the coronavirus crisis when we are all staying home, the screen time of kids has surely increased. Even their school classes are taken online and this is giving screen time a height. If your loving kid is spending too much time watching the screen, then here are some very important things that you need to know.</h4>
<h4>Things to know about screen time and <a href= "https://habitfit.in/"><strong>kids' mental health </strong> </a></h4>
<p>87% of children spend more than recommended time in front of the screen- says a study!</p>
<p>When you allow your kids to watch TV and mobile devices for hours, it is important to understand that it is affecting their physical health and mental wellbeing. </p>
<h4>Here is how it affects kids' health: </h4>
<p>Check out these issues your kids may face. </p>
<h4>Behavioral problems</h4>
<img src="./behavioral-problems.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>It has been noticed that children who spend more time watching the screen are more likely to have behavioral issues. They are highly emotional or they can be found using violence to solve their problems. This can be difficult to identify what's going on in kids' minds and communicating with them and showing them the right path is highly important.</p>
<h4>Low academic performance </h4>
<p>Children need the right study environment and focus to perform better in academics, too much time watching TV or mobile screen reduces their ability to focus and memorize things, and this, in turn, adversely affects their academic performance. </p>1
<p>To ensure that their learning goes in the right direction and they can focus on their studies and learning, they need to have a limited screen time.</p>
<h4>Sleep problems</h4>
<img src="./sleep-problems.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
<p>If your child stays awake when he's supposed to enjoy a peaceful sleep, this can be trouble for their mind. Good night's sleep is important for people of all ages, and it becomes more and more important for kids in their development age.</p>
<p>Avoid giving your kids mobile phones and tablets during the meals and when it's time to go to bed. Make a sleep schedule and ensure that your kids follow the same. This way, they will sleep well, wake up fresh, and stay active all day long.</p>
<h4>Obesity</h4>
<p>Time spent watching TV or videos, playing video games, probably enjoying pizzas, burgers and beverages, all these are signs that your kid is living a sedentary lifestyle. This cause childhood obesity and then it can lead to other health problems.</p>
<p>YInstead of allowing your kids to see some useless contents on the mobile devices, it makes absolute sense if you connect with  <a href= "https://habitfit.in/blogs/22-04-2021/continue-your-fitness-goals.html"><strong>virtual fitness trainer </strong> </a>who can help your kids to stay fit and healthy. Nothing is more beneficial than connecting with online fitness trainers to stay healthy.</p>
<h5>The bottom line</h5>
<p>Now, you must be aware of how important it is to limit your kids' screen time. You need to ensure that kids spend limited screen time and also keep an eye on the things that they watch on mobile devices.</p>
