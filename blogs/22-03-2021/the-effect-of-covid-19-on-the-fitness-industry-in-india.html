            <h3>The effect of Covid-19 on the fitness industry in India</h3>
            <img src="./covid.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
            <p>The Covid-19 outbreak has had a significant impact on all industries, and the fitness industry is no exception. During the lockdown period, when people were advised to stay at home and avoid visiting crowded places, fitness centers were on
                top of the government's list to close down. Small and big, all sizes of fitness centers have suffered a huge loss. Though the industry is recovering well after the lockdown restrictions have been lifted.</p>
            <p>Gold’s gym, a high-end gym chain, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States so as to reconstruct the finances of the company. Moreover, the company closed 30 gyms to restructure and streamline its operations.</p>
            <p>During the pandemic, some new features have been added that are likely to become the way of physical health and mental wellbeing,</p>
            <h3>Some effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the fitness industry</h3>
            <p>Here are a few things to know.</p>
            <h4>Safety is a priority!</h4>
            <img src="./safety.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
            <p>Gyms and/or fitness studios are now expected to become safer than ever. For those resuming the on-ground services, they need proper installation of hand sanitizers and create spacing between the equipment to maintain the distance, following
                the safety rules and protocols has become a must.</p>
            <h4>The virtual offerings gaining popularity</h4>
            <p>Virtual fitness services have become a new normal, the same is accepted by the consumer mindset, the fitness industry is experiencing more consumption online and this seems to continue for the long run. various players in the fitness industry
                are now adapting their services onto digital platforms with the goal to provide consumers with a seamless experience.</p>
            <h4>Holistic wellness became a priority</h4>
            <img src="./holistic.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
            <p>Now, people are thinking beyond physical fitness as mental wellness, spiritual training, and the right diet and nutrition are becoming the focus. To cope with the tense situation, stress reduction techniques and achieving overall health are
                turning out to be a goal. Fitness is becoming wellness-oriented due to more focus on holistic health.</p>
            <p>When we talk about weight loss and fitness apps, the time on these apps has increased by 40% and the number of active users has doubled.</p>
            <h4>New monetization techniques are now in place</h4>
            <img src="./freelancer-fitness.png" class="w-100 mb-2" />
            <p>From freelancers to fitness trainers and influencers to fitness chains, all are moving online to continue service offerings. Some online fitness businesses are working on the freemium model in which services are offered for free whereas some
                services are more personalized in nature and are offered for a price.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has forced fitness centers to limit the on-ground operations, innovate quickly and connect with the consumers virtually. Fitness centers are still unable to open with a substantial footfall as people are still taking
                extreme precautions and social distancing seems here to stay.</p>
            <h4>The bottom line</h4>
            <p>The future of the fitness industry in India seems to be a blend of digital and physical. Now, people know how to juggle many things at home, and hence, players in the fitness industry are expected to come up with more premium workout content
                that takes care of consumer's overall health.</p>
